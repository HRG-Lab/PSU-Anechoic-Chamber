# Measurement Horns
This directory contains all available information on the measurement horn antennas available for use with the anechoic chamber.
This includes Standard Gain Horns (SGH) and other antennas with known gain vs frequency data. 
This information is used for the calibration of the chamber and in the measurement of an antenna under test (AUT).

## Generating a Gain vs Frequency File from Datasheets
An alternative method is available to generate a gain vs frequency data file is not available directly from the vendor but an image is available on a website or datasheet. This section outlines the process for generating this file.

1. Open [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/) or another program/app/etc that can "reverse engineer images of data visualizations to extract the underlying numerical data".
2. more to come...
